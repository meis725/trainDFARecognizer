# trainDFARecognizer
Java program recognize train input, more see below.

A "goods train" is defined to be a string of cars, that must begin with one or two engines. These are followed by one or more trucks, which are followed by one Guard Van.   Example: E E T T T T G 				Non-goods trains: E G; E T T T; E E E T T T G   a. Write a DFA to recognize a goods train. Use E = engine, T = truck, G = guard van.  b. Write a regular expression that generates all legal goods trains.  c. Write a program that recognizes goods trains (says “OK’ or “not OK”).  (Input can be in any convenient form) .  Run your program!  Submit code (short please -- KISS) and outputs.  Use your DFA – translate DFA to code.
